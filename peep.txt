Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Refrain]
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (Make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back? (Do I make you scared?)

[Bridge]
Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road to home
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna glo? Baby, we could glo?

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Outro]
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

In high school, I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear, I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on

Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on

When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you

Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
You like attention, I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us, it's just the two of us, tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I get it, girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I'm not the one

Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Don't you turn your back on me
Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

Man, I don't know what the fuck goin' on lately, bro

Ain't nobody, nobody was talkin' to me like a few months ago
And now everybody hittin' my phone up and shit

I'm a mothafuckin' schema boy, I'm a dreamer boy
I love a girl that don't even fuckin' need a boy
Baby, I'm a beamer boy, I need a beamer, boy

Yeah, I'm in my zone now, I put my phone down
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now
Ya girl, she wanna go down on a real one
I hit JGRXXN, like "What's the deal bruh?"
You see me doin' shows now, I'm a pro now
I got hoes now and I got some dough now
But they don't wanna hear that, they want that real shit
They want that drug talk, that "I can't feel shit"
I'm never comin' home now, all alone now
Can't let my bros down, can't let my bros down
I feel like I'm a no one, that's what they told me
I'ma show ya, baby, I was chosen, ayy

[Verse]
I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I’ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs (Oh, no)
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
I’m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

[Chorus]
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl, you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speedin' down the highway, lookin' at the street lights
Geekin' on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowin' I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I shoulda curved you, I know I'm the worst, boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe, I swear she love gettin' high too
I love gettin' high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm makin' music to cry to

Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know

I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Just look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)

Help me find a way to pass the time (To pass the time)
Everybody tellin' me life's short, but I wanna die (I wanna die)

[Intro: Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron Sample]

The one I have waited centuries to see?
How strange
So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory
Can this be him, this Hellboy?

You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Bitch do)

You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you

Leave me to bleed, I know I got you on your knees
But somethin' keeps on tellin' me
It keeps on tellin' me
Peep, leave it alone, I'm good on my own
Mama miss me at home, but I'm good on my own
Baby, I'm cold, back on the road
Show after show, fuckin' ho after ho
I swear it gets so lonely sometimes
Please just hold me one time
Fuck these hoes and fuck life
I've been waitin' here all damn night
Not one call or text from you (Yeah, ayy)
You're the same as my ex, fuck you
Damn, bitch

I can't fuck with you if we weren't friends on Myspace
Lord why, Lord why, do I wanna die?
I'ma get a Maserati just to take my life inside
Baby, sip this wine, tell me are you down to ride?

Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, ayy

[Bridge]
Ohhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Nooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhh, fuck is you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow
Ohhh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
Nooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I just fell in love with a bad bitch
Told me that she love me, too, baby, I'm not havin' it
Sniffin' cocaine 'cause I didn't have no Actavis
Smokin' propane with my clique and the bad bitches
Call me Cobain, she can see the pain
Look me in the eyes, girl, we are not the same
Bitch, I'll make it rain on my side bitch, shoutout to my main
Fell in love once, and I never been the same

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
Lil Tracy, I used to rob, boy, I shop now
Comin' up, I might get recognized when I walk around
Coolin' with Lil Peep, let's hit the mall tomorrow
I'ma mix American Eagle with some Ralph Lauren
I got a bad bitch who is good to me
Baby, I see passion in your eyes when you look at me
I'ma show you off like some Louis V
Coke lines on the mirror, snort that line for me

Fell in love once and I never been the same

Anything you ever dreamed

And she sweet like Texas tea
With an ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sittin' drinkin' whiskey, hopin' that you'll miss me
